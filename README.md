Infor Visual Inspector
======================

Microsoft Windows(R) Sidebar Gadget with handy stats for Infor's Visual ERP system.

This gadget can be added to a user's desktop.  It displays a variety of (user-selectable) metrics from the ERP system.
For example, an order entry clerk may choose to view the latest incoming orders, overdue orders, and similar information.  
A member of the accounting team might select overdue receivables or payables, while a system administrator might 
choose to see who is logged into the system, or if certain problems exist, etc.

In order to use this gadget effectively, you will need to customize it for your organization.  Someone with basic knowlege of
Javascript and SQL will need to create the specific metrics that your organization needs.  A few example 'inspectors' are
included, but they only scratch the surface of what is possible.  Knowledge of HTML and CSS will be helpful if you want to 
customize the look of the gadget or make extensive customizations.
